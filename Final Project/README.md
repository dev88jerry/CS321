# Final Project

## Program overview

The project goal was to simulate a soccer season. 
A season is comprised of a number of teams that play the other twice. 
A game has a home and away team, both teams have to select 11 players in specific positions. 
A team has a roster of 26 total players. 
A player has a position and certain attributes. 
These elements are combined into a game logic that would calculate the final score. 
Then once all teams have played their games, the season is completed. 
Each team will then have a number of wins, draws, loses displayed to the user in a JFrame window.
